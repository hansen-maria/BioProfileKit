# BioProfileKit

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

BioProfileKit is a specialized bioinformatics tool that enables scientists to analyze large and diverse datasets. 
Unlike traditional profilers, it offers customized analyses for genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, providing sequence analysis and reports on nucleotide or amino acid distribution and abundance. 
It includes advanced visualizations for pattern and anomaly detection, along with interactive dashboards showing key metrics. 
Designed to be user-friendly, BioProfileKit is accessible to scientists without extensive data science skills.

### üìã Features
- **EDA-Focused Analysis** - Offers a detailed overview of data structure, quality, and composition with automated detection of issues like missing values or correlations
- **Specialized Sequence Profiling** - Examines DNA, RNA, and protein sequences using relevant metrics (such as GC content, k-mer frequencies, and amino acid composition)
- **Biological Metadata Recognition** - Automatically identifies and verifies organism names, taxonomic identifiers, and biological annotations using controlled vocabularies from official databases
- **Rich Visualizations** - Creates histograms and interactive charts to help quickly identify patterns
- **Interactive HTML Reports** - Provides portable, user-friendly reports with dynamic filtering and cross-linked visualizations for seamless data exploration

## üîß Installation
**Manual installation**
